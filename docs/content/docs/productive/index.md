Holonix enables developer productivity in a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and extensible way.

Productivity comes from evolving conventions around a set of "golden workflows".

These workflows are relevant to most projects in the Holochain ecosystem.  

- building & testing zomes
- building & testing UIs
- documenting code
- releasing artifacts

The benefits of leveraging a well tested set of conventional scripts will usually outweigh reinventing the wheel here.

E.g. this documentation is generated by the [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) tooling, bash examples recorded with [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/), all automatically deployed to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) by a simple bash script.

Workflows are achieved through a combination of:

- automated management of tools and dependencies on the `$PATH`
- setting environment variables inside a shell session
- simple bash scripts and scaffolding tools
- virtual machines for continuous integration and extended platform support
- conventions and project specific configuration
- leveraging the [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) toolkit
