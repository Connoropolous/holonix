Holonix enables developer productivity in an open and extensible way.

There are several "golden workflows" that are best supported and tested:

- building & testing zomes
- building & testing UIs
- documenting code
- releasing artifacts

Holonix "dogfoods" all relevant golden workflows.  
For example this documentation is generated and deployed by the [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) tooling.

Workflows are achieved through a combination of:

- automated management of tools and dependencies on the `$PATH`
- setting environment variables inside a shell session
- simple bash scripts and scaffolding tools
- virtual machines for continuous integration and extended platform support
- conventions and project specific configuration
- leveraging the [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) toolkit
