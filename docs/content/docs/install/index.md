### Mac

Holonix assumes [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is installed.  
Xcode is the official Mac developer toolkit so is likely to already be installed on a development machine.

Install it from the [Apple app store](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/xcode/id497799835) if needed.

You may need to install the command line tools.  
Follow the instructions if prompted.
